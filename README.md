## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### What I learnt

* I learnt how to add a toggleable dark theme to my projects. 
* I also learnt that using flex-wrap instead of changing the layout at certain breakpoints
can be a good way to naturally change the layout of a page as the width increases.

### Continued development

* I want to explore adding google maps functionality to each country.
